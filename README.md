## Getting Started
1. Clone the Repository:
   ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jaredcassoutt/chess_swiftui.git

2. Open the Project in Xcode:
    - Open Sudoku.xcodeproj in Xcode.
    - Make sure youâ€™re running Xcode 12 or later.
3. Run the App:
    - Build and run on the simulator or an actual device.

## How It Works
The project is organized into several key components:

- **SudokuGridView.swift:** The main layout for the grid, with cell highlighting and selection capabilities.
- **SudokuGenerator.swift:** The engine that generates new puzzles with unique solutions, adjustable by difficulty.

## Future Enhancements
- **Hints and Undo:** Add hints to help players and an undo feature for better control.
